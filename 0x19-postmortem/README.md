#Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on August 15, 2024
##Issue Summary

Duration: August 15, 2024, 08:00 AM to 10:30 AM UTC

##Impact: 
The primary web application was down, resulting in a complete outage for 70% of users attempting to access the site. Affected users encountered a "502 Bad Gateway" error. Internal APIs also failed, causing delays in backend operations for 30% of the remaining users.

##Root Cause: 
The root cause was an unexpected memory leak in a recently updated version of the Nginx server, which led to the exhaustion of system memory and the subsequent crash of web services.

##Timeline

07:55 AM: Monitoring alerts detected a spike in 502 errors across the web application.
08:00 AM: Issue confirmed by the on-call engineer after receiving multiple alerts and customer complaints.
08:10 AM: Initial investigation focused on the load balancer configuration, suspecting misrouting issues.
08:30 AM: Network team consulted to rule out firewall or DNS issues.
09:00 AM: Further investigation pointed to Nginx server logs showing memory allocation failures.
09:15 AM: Incident escalated to the DevOps team to investigate the memory issue.
09:30 AM: Identified a memory leak in the recently deployed Nginx version.
10:00 AM: Rolled back to the previous stable version of Nginx, gradually restoring service.
10:30 AM: Full service restored, monitoring confirmed normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution

##Root Cause:
The issue was caused by a memory leak in the Nginx server following an update to version 1.21.6, which was deployed during a routine maintenance window. The new version introduced an unintended bug in the memory management module, causing the system memory to be consumed rapidly. Once the memory was fully utilized, the Nginx process crashed, leading to the 502 Bad Gateway errors observed by users.

##Resolution:
The resolution involved rolling back to the previous stable version of Nginx (1.21.5). This rollback was performed after confirming that the memory leak was not present in the older version. The rollback process involved restarting all web services and flushing the cache to ensure that no corrupted data persisted. Post-deployment monitoring showed a return to normal memory usage levels and restored full service functionality.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures

##Improvements and Fixes:

##Thorough Testing: 
Ensure that any new version of software, particularly Nginx, undergoes rigorous testing in a staging environment under heavy load conditions before being deployed to production.

##Enhanced Monitoring: 
Implement detailed monitoring for memory usage across all web servers, specifically targeting Nginx processes.

##Incident Response Drill: 
Conduct regular incident response drills focusing on rapid rollback procedures to reduce downtime in similar future scenarios.

##Tasks:

##Patch Nginx: 
Work with the vendor or community to identify the root cause of the memory leak in Nginx 1.21.6 and apply a patch when available.

##Add Memory Monitoring: 
Set up detailed memory usage alerts specific to the Nginx service to detect abnormal behavior earlier.

##Review Deployment Pipeline: 
Adjust the CI/CD pipeline to include stress testing for key services before deploying to production.

##Update Incident Playbook: 
Include a specific section on memory-related issues and rollback procedures for Nginx in the incident response playbook.

##User Communication Protocol: 
Develop a clear protocol for communicating outages to users in real time, minimizing confusion and customer support load during incidents.
